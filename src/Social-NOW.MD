### User Stories:

A list of user input and use cases regarding the improvements and benefits of EasyScript
*	(Systems Engineer) : As a Systems Engineer, I would like a feature where I can view the running script’s output in the same window on top of a download .js format feature. This would allow for easier script execution and visualization. 
* (Software Development Engineer): As a Software Development Engineer, I would like an integrated on platform text editor where I can easily test and compile my code.
*	(Software Quality Engineer) : As a Software Quality Engineer, I would like a feature that would allow for syntax highlighting, checking, and autocomplete. This would allow for me to catch compilation issues before they occur, which would help in the debugging process. 

### High Level Overview:
 
#### Phase 1:
Phase 1 consists of brainstorming our implementation and creating a rough sketch of our planned features and UI/UX design. Below is a high-level overview of our MVP implementation:
1.	Create a UI/UX design of our Easy Script text-editor on Figma. 
2.	Utilize Microsoft’s open source Monaco editor for our base.
3.	Implement syntax highlighting, checking, and autocomplete with ReactJS. 
4.	Display output of compilation on the same webpage for easier visualization. 
5.	Implement a feature for downloading script as .js with ReactJS

#### Phase 2: 
Phase 2 consists of quality of life features that would allow our users to have a personalized and smooth experience of our EasyScript text-editor.
Below are possible ideas of phase 2 features:
1.	Directly import code into the scripts background by uploading a JavaScript file.
2.	Different language text editor support 

#### Phase 3:
Phase 3 consists of possible features that can be added to the future that would help with the development process using Scripts – Background
•	Direct importation of ServiceNow’s scripted RestAPI.
•	Compilation output displaying compile error and warnings on the wrong line.

### Deployment:
Once we complete the development of EasyScripts with reactJS, we will deploy it using nodeJS.

### Install and Configuration:  
•	Check out master branch and git clone EasyScript repo
•	Run NPM server in order to create a localhost to view EasyScript project
